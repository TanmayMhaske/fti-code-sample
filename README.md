# FTI Consulting Code Sample: Enterprise Project Management Tool Work Sample Files

## Important Note

**This is a code snippet collection, not a complete, production-ready project.** The files are designed to showcase TypeScript, Node.js, and React expertise through representative code samples.

## Purpose

To illustrate technical capabilities in TypeScript development for the Director, Software Solutions Lead role at FTI Consulting.

## Technology Overview

Our codebase leverages TypeScript across the full stack, demonstrating advanced type safety and modern web development practices. Key technologies include Node.js with Express, React 18, and comprehensive type definitions using Zod for runtime validation.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Error Handling**: Custom middleware
- **Validation**: Type-based validation

## File Descriptions

- **User Controller (`UserController.ts`)**: Demonstrates server-side type validation, error handling, and dependency injection with strongly typed input schemas and generics.
- **React User Management Component (`UserForm.tsx`)**: Showcases React functional components, hooks (useState, useCallback), and type-safe form management with inline type definitions.
- **Advanced TypeScript Definitions (`User.ts`)**: Highlights sophisticated type system capabilities including utility types, interfaces, role-based type constraints, and generic repository patterns.
  -- **ErrorHandler (`ErrorHandler.ts`)**: Centralized error handling middleware with detailed error responses

## Development Practices

- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Type-safe data models
- Modular architecture
- Comprehensive error handling

## Setup and Usage

These code samples are intended for review and should not be directly run as a complete application.
